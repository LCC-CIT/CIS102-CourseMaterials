# CIS 102: Problem Solving with Computers
CIS 102 introduces students to methods and tools for solving problems in an information systems environment.  
The emphasis of the course will be on problem solving in an algorithmic context&mdash;
that is, given a problem statement how does one create a series of steps to solve the problem with a computer
by either designing an algorithm which may later be implemented with a programming language, or by utilizing existing application software like Excel.  
Students will be introduced to a programming language as well as become experienced in using spreadsheet and drawing software as problem-solving tools.  
The course is designed as an introductory course in the CIT Departmentâ€™s degree programs.
